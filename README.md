### What happens? 
Feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, difficulty in carrying out daily tasks, including caring for themselves, for the newborn, and/or for others.

### Impacts? 
Episodes of constant mental stress and psychosis arising from perinatal depression are detrimental for women health and can also be fatal for 
the fetus or the new-born.

### Caused by?
Combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
- Life stress (for example, experiences of past trauma).
- Physical and emotional demands of childbearing and caring for a new baby.
- Hormonal changes during and after pregnancy.
- Personal or family history of depression or bipolar disorder.
- Experienced perinatal depression with a previous pregnancy.



# 2 Project Plan
- Create a predictive model whether a given subject is likely to have perinatal depression or not.
- Look closely to read into the different physiological and environmental features of the subjects.
- Design and analyze how accurately can environmental features alone predict the onset of perinatal depression 
in subjects.
- Design Classification Models using:
-- Logistic Regression: apply feature selection techniques, Ridge Regression, and Lasso
 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
 Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
 Naïve Bayes
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
 Classification Decision Tree
